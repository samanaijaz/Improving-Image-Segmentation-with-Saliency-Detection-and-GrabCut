# Improving Image Segmentation with Saliency Detection and GrabCut

This pipleline aims to improve image segmentation of an image using image saliency and GrabCut.

## Requirements


igraph 

run "!pip install igraph" (on COLAB) (already done in "CV_Project_Final.ipynb")


## How To Run

To run on Google Colab, follow the following steps :

1. Upload the "code.ipynb" file on Google Colab.
2. Upload the image file you want to run the pipeline on.
3. Change the filepath in the pipeline by changing the "file_path" variable in the second code block as file_path = "/content/[FILE NAME]", eg : file_path = "/content/flower.jpg"
4. Run all the codeblocks

To run on local jupyter notebooks, the file paths defined in the code have to be changed accordingly.
